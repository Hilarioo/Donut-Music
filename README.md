Interactive instruments with visualizers.

Donut Music üç© is a full-stack web application built with TypeScript, React + Redux, Node.js, p5.js, tone.js, socket.io, and sqlite3.
It features a violin, guitar, drums, and flute as instruments and four unique visualizers. Our visualizers react to the amps, hertz, and/or speed of the song or key playing. 

Yes! We have songs within our database that holds metadata like the songs artist, publisher, song title, and notes. It's dockerized into two containers (client & server), then called by docker-compose. The client docker is optimized using an nginx template on the build only. Lastly, an AWS EC2 instance allows us to showcase this project to the world(:
